//! The host's service between guest slices: the restore host, the host's
//! inputs, network and NOR, its power button and the log stores. The guest
//! storage's host transfers need none: its controller submits each one and
//! completes it once the disk has (`ans::host`).
//!
//! Guest time passes while a PE's core serves the host, and another PE may
//! spin on a lock the served PE's guest holds; XNU panics when a spinlock
//! is held past its timeout. With every PE on a host core of its own, a PE
//! that waits for an interrupt serves the host ([`serve`]), as it holds no
//! such lock, and a device that leaves bytes for the host wakes one that
//! sleeps (`Hub::request_service`). The boot PE serves whole only while it
//! waits for an interrupt itself, or always when the PEs run serialized.
//! Once no PE has served for [`STARVED_MILLIS`] it takes one bounded step
//! between its slices ([`step`]): the parts in turn, until one ends past
//! [`STEP_MICROS`], the next step going on from the part after it. The
//! shared count stops at what its guest code earned while it serves
//! (`clock`), so a step stops every PE's time for its length.
