//! Apple's IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED System registers and MSR (immediate).
//!
//! Architectural System registers and System instructions go through the
//! generated AARCHMRS accessors (`machine::system`). This module handles the
//! op0=3 CRn=15 space Apple uses: SPRR, GXF, the Apple PAC controls,
//! VMSA_LOCK_EL1, the VM timer FIQ enables, the Apple generic timer
//! (`machine::timer::agt`), AMX, the performance monitor (`machine::pmu`)
//! and the `machine::impdef` table. Every other encoding in
//! that space (CRn 11 and 15) that the chip's censused components access
//! refuses with its fields; one they never access is UNDEFINED.
//!
//! With EL2 present and HCR_EL2.E2H RES1, Apple's registers follow the VHE
//! pattern their names show (m1n1 `cpu_regs.h`): at EL2 the `*_EL1` and
//! `*_GL1` encodings reach the EL2 and GL2 state and the `*_EL12`, `*_EL02`
//! and `*_GL12` encodings reach the EL1 and GL1 state (inference from the
//! names and from m1n1 `gxf_asm.S`). HCR_EL2.TIDCP traps the whole
//! IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED space from EL1 to EL2.
