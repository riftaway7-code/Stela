//! The host disk under ANS's namespaces.
//!
//! A host transfer takes as long as the host's storage does. Each I/O
//! command's transfer is submitted where the guest rings the doorbell, as
//! many at once as the guest queues, through the block layer
//! ([`Submission`]), which runs them on the disk as it has room. The
//! controller completes each command once the disk has completed its
//! transfer, in whatever order that happens, as a real controller completes
//! commands once its media has. It looks once the disk has posted a
//! completion. A disk that signals its completions wakes the core that
//! looks, so it looks otherwise only for a lost signal; for one that does
//! not, it looks after half the disk's recent latency, then more often
//! (Linux's hybrid polling). Nothing waits for the disk and nothing wakes
//! while no transfer runs. A disk that runs nothing queued executes each
//! command on the calling PE. One poll admits at most 64 commands, so larger
//! transfers keep their partial progress until later polls. The boot stages
//! the guest's disk: there a submission and a look only queue commands and
//! take results, and the host I/O runs outside the devices' lock.
//!
//! A mounting APFS deallocates tens of thousands of ranges, which already
//! read as zeros ([`super::namespace::Medium::deallocate`]), so a Deallocate
//! completes at once and the disk hears of them in the background, as
//! Linux's `fstrim` tells it in batches: [`Discards`] keeps them merged and
//! sends a batch once guest transfers have paused for [`DISCARD_QUIET`]: a
//! disk runs a large deallocation for milliseconds, and a read queued behind
//! it waits that long. A flush that waits for discards sends them at once.
//! Discards never reorder past
//! writes. A write takes its blocks back from those waiting and waits out a
//! batch it overlaps, and a flush waits for all of them where the guest was
//! told deallocated blocks stay zeros, as a controller's cache holds them.
