//! Persistent storage service across the engine's shadow-page-table roots.
//!
//! PC drivers currently use identity addresses for their ECAM/MMIO and DMA
//! buffers. Keep their accesses in the loader's root, which also
//! maps the engine window, and restore the current engine root afterwards.
//! This boundary never maps host identity addresses into a guest root. All
//! buffers passed here belong to the engine window, not guest virtual RAM.
//!
//! The drivers keep each controller's state in `Rc` and `RefCell`, for one
//! owner at a time, while the service and every PE reach host devices from
//! cores of their own: a USB disk the guest drives and the USB keyboard the
//! service reads share one xHCI controller. [`RestoreRoot`] is the only way
//! into a driver, so it also holds the host drivers' lock, which serializes
//! them and orders each holder's writes before the next holder's reads.
//!
//! While the engine runs ([`TaggedRoots`]), the loader's root has a TLB
//! context of its own, so a driver call keeps the engine's translations.
