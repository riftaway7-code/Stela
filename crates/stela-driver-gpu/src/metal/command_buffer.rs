//! `MTLCommandBuffer` recording: encoders lowered to Vulkan commands.
//!
//! A command buffer records into segments. Encoding a wait for an event
//! starts a new segment that waits on the event's timeline semaphore, and
//! encoding a signal ends the current one, so each segment is one
//! `VkSubmitInfo2` of one Vulkan command buffer. Every segment begins with a
//! full barrier, which orders it after everything submitted earlier on the
//! queue; the [`Hazards`] tracker adds barriers inside a segment.
//!
//! Encoder state is the command buffer's: one encoder is active at a time,
//! as in Metal. Its operations are in [`render`], [`compute`] and [`blit`].
