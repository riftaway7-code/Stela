//! The mount's own network client over the host's first network adapter:
//! the restore client's signing-server requests (TSS), the
//! connectivity check (`--network-check`) and a remote install image's
//! ranged downloads (`engine::remote`), which share it.
//!
//! UEFI's Simple Network Protocol ends with boot services, and the request
//! is made during the restore, long after ExitBootServices, so the client
//! runs the runtime's dual-stack client (`stela_runtime::net`) over the adapter's
//! after-EBS driver (`stela_drivers::net::virtio`, `stela_drivers::net::igc`
//! for an Intel I225/I226, `stela_drivers::net::e1000e` for an Intel 82574L,
//! `stela_drivers::net::igb` for supported Intel 82575–I211 copper adapters,
//! or `stela_drivers::usb::cdc` for a USB Ethernet
//! adapter). Its registers and DMA pages are identity-mapped in the
//! loader's root, so every frame moves inside that root
//! (`storage::RestoreRoot`), as block and input I/O do.
