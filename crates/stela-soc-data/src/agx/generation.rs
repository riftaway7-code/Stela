//! The Apple GPUs 26A434 supports: each SoC's `sgx` compatible, the AGX kext
//! its kernelcache links, the GFX firmware its BuildManifest names, and the
//! facts each kext fixes about the AP-visible interface (from a census of
//! all 59 board DeviceTrees and all 13 AGX kexts).
//!
//! Known (every 26A434 kernelcache, `AGXAccelerator*::readChipInfo`,
//! `AGXSecureMonitor*::setupMMUConfig`/`invalidateGPUTTBACache` and
//! `AGXArmFirmware::initFirmwareData` of each kext; offsets per kext in §6):
//! - every kext reads the identification words at 0xd04000.. and requires
//!   one generation in bits 31:24 of 0xd04000 ([`Family::generations`]);
//! - G13's MMU block puts the TTBAT page at 0xd08024 and the TTBA-cache
//!   invalidation at 0xd08028 behind eight fixed words; G14 onwards use
//!   0xd0802c and 0xd08030 behind ten ([`Mmu`]). The page field is 26 bits on
//!   the G13G and G14G kexts and 28 bits on every other;
//! - the initdata root's first word differs between interface revisions; the
//!   G13G, G13X and G14G kexts write the same one ([`Family::initdata_magic`]).
//!
//! A family is admitted ([`Gpu::admitted`]) only when every layout the GFX
//! firmware model and the `sgx` model use has been checked against that
//! family's own kext and firmware ([`Interface::Modeled`] carries them as a
//! [`Model`]). Today that is G14G, the two G13 families, whose kexts write
//! the same initdata, rings and channels (aligned function by function) and
//! whose firmware runs the same device-control and signal handlers except
//! the dashboard signal it lacks ([`Family::dashboard_signals`]), and G14X,
//! whose kext and firmware keep the same protocol with its own initdata
//! magic, shared-object offsets ([`Layout`]), identification words and GPC
//! block, and G15G, which keeps G14X's protocol
//! with its own initdata magic and three shared offsets. Every other family
//! is named here with the facts recovered so far and stays hidden by the
//! loader, its refusal naming what is missing. A modeled family's GPU is
//! admitted only with an identification a source states ([`Gpu::identity`]).
